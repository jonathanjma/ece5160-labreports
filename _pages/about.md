Hello there!

I'm Jonathan Ma, a senior at Cornell University majoring in CS interested in embedded software, robotics, and backend development.
I’m particularly passionate about their applications to aerospace and autonomous systems.
In my free time, I enjoy photography, hiking, and exploring new places!
